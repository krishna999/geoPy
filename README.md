# geoPy
This program uses the bokeh plotting library to create an interactive front end where changes to rock and fluid properties can be explored.

The program can be run by executing in the command line.

```cmd
bokeh serve --show geoPy.py
```

Additional rock, fluid and pressure property profiles can be added by editing the three input CSV files.
+ *geoPy_Rocks.csv*
+ *geoPy_Fluids.csv*
+ *geoPy_Pres.csv*
